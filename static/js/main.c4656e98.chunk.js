Regardless of who I will work with, a developer or a designer, it does not matter, knowledge of how to manage projects and competent management of them will help to achieve very high results in the future. At first, the project management course seemed routine and not at all interesting to me, since after the start of the course there was a lot of monotonous work, then as we progressed it became more and more interesting. Thanks to this course, I realize fully what project management is. That is, first learn how to make plans, take into account stakeholders, make schedules, define goals and missions, fully disclose the topic, think about financing, distribute tasks in the team, think about the team, record all changes, think about suppliers, think about the future, and so on. In the sequel. All these skills are undoubtedly very important for the project manager. Of course, some skills are useful not only to the project manager. And I wrote 4 documents: Project Proposal, Project Initiation, Project Planning, Project Execution. All these documents are useful for my project, and it was also useful for me to write my dissertation, because I get a lot of new information about how to properly manage my project. As I said earlier, thanks to this course, I also acquired useful skills as a full stack developer. All tasks in this course were individual. But I think it would be better if we could work as a team. It would help us work better as a team. So, now we have more than one copy of the same documents, because each participant worked individually, and there is no special benefit from this. It seems to me that such a course must necessarily be a team course, so it will be easier for students to work, and they will develop teamwork. At the same time, we took the course \u201cApplied Application Analysis\u201d, very similar to this one, and in this course all the tasks were team tasks, which helped us a lot to write a dissertation in a team. And we already have, at least, sketches for our dissertation. I also think there were too many assignments in this course. Compared to other courses, there are certainly a lot of tasks here. 10 frames of lectures, practical tasks, short notes, 4 quizzes, 4 main tasks and read a book of more than 700 pages. That's a lot. In other courses, there were a maximum of 10 tasks in total, and compared to the courses that we took in parallel, it was a maximum of 7 laboratory tasks. I believe that 4 main tasks would be enough for this course, and then the quality of student work would increase. I don't think there are students who are satisfied with such a number of tasks. Moreover, few people want to become project managers, and such a number of tasks only repels students. As a project for this course, I chose my dissertation \"Development of a restaurant aggregator mobile application\". Our scientific supervisor is Ibraeva D. And these 10 weeks and till present I've been writing about this project. A brief description of my project. Our most important idea is to create an application for online booking in food and leisure establishments. So, first of all, we started by describing our problem, that is, what it really is. We have determined the sides of interaction, that is, what kind of application we will have. We have determined that our application is B2C, although both business and guests are our users. In this regard, we had to divide them into the appropriate categories for further work: Establishments and Visitors. As you understand, we have to make different applications for each one. But let's leave this plan a bit and tell you how we are going to attract people and interest in the application. Yes, we have big plans to introduce a wide range of services into the application, especially the creation of our own automated service similar to R-Keeper for the possibility of ordering food by users in advance and all the bases were interconnected. So far, we have decided to start acting according to the following scheme: 1. Creating an aggregator of establishments with smart filters and the ability to leave a review and evaluate. This is done for several purposes, firstly, to get feedback from people, whether the application is interesting, how convenient it is to use, and secondly, to get statistics, for further presentation to institutions that we have the power and can already start attracting profit to them. 2. Create an admin panel (an application for staff) to conclude contracts with institutions and start implementing reservations. 3. Introduction of the QR menu. Yes, I know that this is far from a novelty and is available in some institutions, but these are the only available technologies that cannot be scaled, and we will introduce this to all partners. That is, a person comes to a restaurant without a reservation, sits down in an empty seat and scans the QR code through our application and orders food, pays for and receives cooked food. 4. The introduction of AI and ML to strengthen our application with the help of recommendations and smart push, which will increase conversion and, so to speak, anticipate the desires of users one step ahead. In conclusion, I want to say that, from my point of view, if we take into account the shortcomings that I wrote about earlier, students will be only too happy to take this course. That is, if they are allowed to work in a team, since it makes no sense to have more than 1 copy of the same work, since students will still have to reread all this and combine the works, and this is additional work. And if students work in a team, they will be able to seriously take up work and immediately write a dissertation. If you leave only 4 main tasks. Not everyone will read a book with more than 700 pages, because most students want to be server developers, and this book is not interesting to them. I also think that all artifacts should be removed since they are also useless for dissertation. These 4 tasks will last for 10 weeks, and for the final exam, you can also simply remove the artifacts. And devote more time to these 4 tasks to improve the quality of students' work."),o.a.createElement("h1",{id:"individual_projects",style:{margin:"50px 0px",color:"#e3e3e3"}},"Individual projects"),o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"#b8b8b8",fontSize:"25px"}},"1.
